My name is Myles Enriquez. Born and raised in Las Vegas. Started climbing when I was 18. As they all say, I was hooked from the start.

Ever since the start, I've read all kinds of climbing books, watched all kinds of videos, scrolled through all kinds of photos, and have become obsessed with it.

I mainly do sport and boulder but would love to go out and try some trad.
