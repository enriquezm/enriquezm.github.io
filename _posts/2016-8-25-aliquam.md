I spent so many days, weeks, years talking about climbing. I live it. I breath it. It's literally a part of me and I'm sure it'll be around for a long time. For so long I've thought about writing about my experiences. My travels. My sketched planned missions when it came to rock climbing that finally I've decided I'm going to share it all.

From what I did as a beginner to what I'm doing now as an average climber trying to get better, I'm documenting it all.

I love this stuff. The epicness. The torture. The conquering. The building of character that climbing brings for me. I'm sharing it all.

If you also enjoy this, follow along. Read it, repost it. I want to share everything I know, and ask about what I don't. I'm not sure where this blog is going to take me, but I hope it breaks some type of positivity, or perspective to the climbing community.

Climb on!
